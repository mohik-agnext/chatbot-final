NOTIFICATION No 3288 Dated, Chandigarh the: 4-12-2420 The Administrator, Union Territory, Chandigarh is pleased to notifs Parking Policy for Chandigarh, which will be applicable to the entire Union Territory of Chandigarh (except abadi areas of villages), in view of the directions of the Ho'nble Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh dated 24.01.2020 in CWP-PIL No. 78 of 2019 to curb the parking problems within the city and to reduce the traffic congestion. The general public can access the said notification on the official website of Chandigarh Administration at the address dhasdahemihdmsuwnaahmin kJ Arun Kumar Gupta, IAS Principal Secretary Home-cum- Chief Administrator, (On behalf of H.G., the Administrator), Union Territory, Chandigarh. 

CHANDIGARH ADMINISTRATION PARKING POLICY 1. Background: Union Territory, Chandigarh, has population of 10.54 lakh as per census conducted in the year 2011. The city is the capital of the States of Haryana and Punjab. The towns of Panchkula (population 2.11 lakh in 2011) in Haryana and Mohali (population 1.76 lakh in 2011) in Punjab are very close and constitute part of Chandigarh Urban Complex. Besides, Zirakpur and Kharar in Punjab are also coming up in the vicinity and are almost part of this agglomeration now. Thus, making Chandigarh Urban Complex practically a larger urban area. Chandigarh is a premier center for education, medical institutes and emerging fast as a major IT/ITES hub in North India. The city is having one of the highest per capita income in India. The high growth and improvement in living standards has led to remarkable increase in the number of registered motorized vehicles and their resultant increased use in the absence of adequate and quality public transport system in Chandigarh. It is a well-known fact that the city is getting clogged with increasing number of private vehicles every year. As per 2015, statistics of the Administration more than 10 lakhs vehicles are present in the city; out of which 35% are cars and remaining is wo-wheeler. The problem of parking is acute in the city especially in the high density commercialresidential areas. Most of the neighborhood shopping centers in the city have now turned into specialized markets. For example Sector-22 has developed a Jewellers Market; Sector-11 and 16 have Chemists & Medical equipment's market due to proximity to the major hospitals and Sector-18 & 19 have become popular for electrical market & kitchen appliances etc. These neighbourhood markets are attracting city level traffic, which leads to acute problem of parking. In residential areas, particularly for Marla row housing and LIG/EWS housing, many people are parking their vehicles on the street and using the setback portion for gardening and plantation works etc., whereas cars are encroaching the right of way of pedestrians and public spaces. Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in CWP-PIL No. 78 of 2019 and connected matters directed that the Chandigarh Administration should finalize the Parking Policy within a period of 90 days. Therefore, in compliance to the directions passed by Hon'ble High Court, the present Parking policy is being notified to reduce & resolve the chaotic parking situation in all areas of the city including residential, commercial, institutional, industrial etc. The guidelines primarily focus on strict enforcement to prevent misuse of limited resources, reclaim the right of way of pedestrians and restrict parking of vehicles on invaluable greens of the city. 2. Introduction Land is valuable in all urban areas. Parking places occupy large portions of such land. This fact will be recognized in determining the principles for allocation of parking space. Parking is an essential component of the transportation system. A typical vehicle run for one hour on an average and is parked for 23 hours in a day. It is also important to consider that a typical vehicle usually need three different parking spaces-one at the owner's residence, second at owner's office/business place and third at recreatonalentetahment facilities. 1 

2.1 Approach to the Parking policy Traffic management and parking policy are closely interlinked and will serve a wider set of environmental, social and economic objectives. The city needs to give high priority to parking control initiatives, which encourage a shift from the use of personal modes of travel, especially the 2-wheeler and cars, to public transport, walking or cycling; and to traffic management program, which reduce accidents, congestion, pollution and dependency on personal modes of transportation. Rather than having a reactive parking policy, the Administration intends to have a dynamic parking policy which constantly change with the ever-increasing number of vehicles. The guidelines will itself lead to a reduction in the need for parking and support more strategic planning objectives. The lack of available parking and the price one has to pay for it are powerful incentives for people to consider alternative modes of transport. Transport choices can be influenced strongly by restrictions on convenient parking at the journey's end. Parking spaces (on-street and off-street) have to be selected sO as to have least impact on the flow of traffic. In such cases, parking shall not be available at all locations and people must have to finish their journey on foot or by other modes of transport. In a city where a large share of trips are to be handled ideally by the public transport system, the intermediate modes of transport (auto rickshaws, taxis etc.) becomes important to fill gaps left by the public transport grid. If no space has been allocated for these vehicles, they shall be parked or wait for rides on the roads and create major obstruction to traffic. Therefore, valuable parking spaces will be set aside for their use, especially at interchange locations, like at bus terminals (both private and public), railway stations and at commercial centers. At the same time, a separate study for demand management need to be done to reduce the need for parking over a period of time. The land use recommendations of notified Chandigarh Master Plan 2031 are also enlisted at Pt9 of Annexure. 2.2 Aims of the Guidelines:- 1. Encouraging use of alternative modes of transport and reduce motor vehicle use (thereby reducing traffic congestion, accidents and pollution). 2. Ability to accommodate new traffic management concept and respond to traffic problems. 3. Appropriate use of land with promotion of environment friendly measures. 2.3 Citizens' cooperation and participation: People's cooperation is essential to install a sense of discipline to obey traffic and parking regulations. The creation of parking infrastructure require not only funds and technology but also cooperation of the vehicle owners. Indiscriminate parking in front of business and personal places in violation of parking norms shall defeat this effort. This is a difficult aspect but it can be achieved by involving market associations, resident's welfare associations and interest groups who are keen to make the city a good place to live in. New concepts like car free day, congestion taxes, vehicle free zones etc. need to be promoted by such interest groups. Public education, awareness campaigns and public participation programme shall play an important role in giving this policy a wide acceptance. 2 

2.4 National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP), MoUD The National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP), 2006, which has been later revised and reorganized in 2014. Following paragraph explains NUTP's approach towards parking management: The National Urban Transport Policy recognizes that in a developing economy, ownership of personal vehicles will continue to increase for the next few years. Hence, the Policy does not discourage the ownership of such vehicles but only seeks to discourage daily usage. It recommends interventions that would encourage people to use public transport for their daily commute to work and for education, but for periodic recreational trips with their families; they could use personal motor vehicles. Limiting the availability of parking space and the levy of a high parking fee must be used as a means to curb the use of personal motor vehicles. Preference in the allocation of parking space for public transport vehicles and non-motorized modes as well as easier access of work places to and from such spaces would go a long way in encouraging the use of sustainable transport systems. Park and ride facilities for bicycle users, with convenient inter-change, would be another useful measure. Simultaneously, a graded scale of parking fee, that recovers the economic cost of the land used in such parking, will be adopted. The objective would be to persuade people to use public transport to reach city centers and restrict the access of personal motor vehicles to such city centers. 2.5 Key elements and Guiding Principles: A) The key elements of parking supply include: 1. The number of parking places by type (i.e.on-and off-street parking); 2 The location of parking places by type (e.g. out-of-town Park and Ride facilities etc.); Parking supply is of course mediated depending on who owns and controls it. On-street parking is almost totally owned and mostly controlled by local authorities; off-street parking will be owned and or controlled by either the local authorities or private operator. B) Key guiding principles basically consist of: 1 Parking requirements, i.e. the numbers of parking spa√ßes that must be supplied at a particular location, which is often mandated in zoning codes or development requirements based on, published standards. 2 Parking regulations, which typically include free parking, time restrictions, users' restrictions (e.g. parking only for residents, or disabled, or public transport passengers etc.) and pricing parking. 3 Marketing, i.e. trying to persuade car users to use specific parking locations, such as campaigns to use Park & Ride facilities, or specific payment methods such as paying by mobile phones etc. 4 Information and Communication, such as (dynamic) route guidance to (available) parking places, either at the road side (information) or via IT system (communication). "Parking regulations are defined as "regulations that control who, when, and how long vehicles will park at a particular location in order to prioritize parking facility use". They typically include time restrictions, users' restrictions e.g. parking only for residents or for disabled = and pricing of parking. The latter is probably the most powerful and, from a political point of view, controversial tool of parking policy". 3 

3. PROPOSALS: 3.1 Parking Regulations:- 1. Staff buses to be plied by all GovernmentPSU Organizations' Industriall IT companies with more than 50 employees. Shuttle service will be started by various institutions (i.e. IT Park, Industrial Area, Hospitals, Public Offices e.g. Chandigarh Administration etc. to discourage use of personal vehicles). 2.

Car/vehicle free zone to be accessed comfortably and enjoyed by the residents. 4. As a pilot project Neighborhood Shopping Centre, Sector 11 shall be taken up, where proposal of taking the V4 and parking sub-grade can be explored while leaving free access to residential houses along V4. The feasibility of the concept and the view point of the stakeholders to be taken to finalize the proposal. 5. In case of Sector 23 1 Sector 8 for example, the underground parking can be created be near the internal central court which will release land for open space pedestrian plaza above. Parking Solution for Institutional Buildings. Parking within campus - Additional FAR is being allowed for making provisions 1. Multilevel parking blocks 2. For already constructed campuses which are architecturally controlled - underground parking beyond the footprint of buildings/ along institutional belts Jan Marg and Madhya Marg. 3. Parking demands can be controlled by implementing transport management measures such as Use of car pools for schools and offices. Carf free days ones in a week. Segregated timing of office hours Use of power driven vehicles within car free zones. Parking facilities at MRTS corridor 1. Parking lots at Metro Stations / Metro Nodes. 2. Park and Ride concept shall be facilitated at Metro/BRTS/Bus Stands. 3. Augmentation of parking facilities with latest State of the Art technology. 4. Whilst the ongoing proposals for multilevel parking are adopting traditional practices, in view of cost considerations, it is recommended that in future semi-automated /1 fully automated / latest 10 

technology is adopted which will optimize space within city. The selection of the type of parking system shall take into consideration the ground realities/ feasibility / urban design aspects. 5. To maintain the green open spaces within city, underground parking lots are recommended as a general solution, however, in the Industrial Area, where high rise buildings are being constructed, over ground parking lots can be considered as community parking in vacant parking lots. 6. Mandating full occupancy of cars entering commercial centers and other designated areas. 11
