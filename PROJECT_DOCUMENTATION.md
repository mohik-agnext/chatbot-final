    """Production API with error handling and metrics"""
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        query = request.json.get('message')
        results = hybrid_search(query)
        response = generate_llm_response(query, results)
        
        # Performance tracking
        response_time = time.time() - start_time
        log_performance_metrics(response_time)
        
        return jsonify({
            'response': response,
